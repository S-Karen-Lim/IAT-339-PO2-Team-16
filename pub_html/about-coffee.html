    <h2>Coffee isn't just a choice, it's a life style</h2>
        <p>Here at Customo, we work hard to bring the highest quality beans to you. Sometimes you don't know the difference - but we do.
        Fear not, we don't want you just to buy our products, we want you to understand them like we understand you. </p>

        <p>Our coffees are categorized between light, medium, and dark roast. The degree in which the beans are roasted is one of most
        key factors when creating the perfect coffee. The color of the beans also change based on how long you roast it. Oils are
        released onto the surface.</p>

        <p>So which one is for you? It'll take some trial and error, but as fellow lovers we encourage you to try them all out!
        The roast doesn't determine anything; every bean can and will taste different. It's our job to help you find that special bean.</p>

        <h3>Light Roast</h3>
            <p>Light roasts have very little oil on the surface and are light brown in color. These beans are roasted until their internal
            temperature reaches 180°C - 205°C. At this point the beans will crack and expand. </p>

        <h3>Medium Roast</h3>
            <p>Medium roasts also have very little oil on the surface but are medium brown in color. They are roasted until their internal
            temperature is 210°C - 220°C. They are taken off the heat right between the beans are about to roast a second time. </p>

        <h3>Dark Roast</h3>
            <p>Dark roats feel heavier and will have oil showing on the surface. They have a much richer and dark color than the other roasts.
            The beans are roasted until after their second cracking, at an internal temperature of 204°C or higher. The amount of caffine
            has been decreased and the beans will have a smoky and burnt smell and taste. </p>
