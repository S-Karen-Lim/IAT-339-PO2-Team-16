    <h2 class="coffee_roast">Coffee isn't just a choice, it's a Lifestyle</h2>
        <p class="introduction_to_coffee">Here at Customo, we work hard to bring the highest quality beans to you. Sometimes you don't know the difference - but we do.
        Fear not, we don't want you just to buy our products, we want you to understand them like we understand you. </p>

        <p class="introduction_to_coffee">Our coffees are categorized between light, medium, and dark roast. The degree in which the beans are roasted is one of most
        key factors when creating the perfect coffee. The colour of the beans also change based on how long you roast it. Oils are then
        released onto the surface, giving coffee the colour that coffee is and known for.</p>

        <p class="introduction_to_coffee">So which one is for you? It'll take some trial and error, but as fellow lovers we encourage you to try them all out!
        The roast doesn't determine anything; every bean can and will taste different. It's our job to help you find that special bean.</p>

        <div class="block roast-text-block">
        <h3 class="roasts_titles">Light Roast</h3>
            <p>Light roasts have very little oil on the surface and are light brown in colour. These beans are roasted until their internal
            temperature reaches 180°C - 205°C. This point the beans will crack and expand. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block roast-text-block">
        <h3 class="roasts_titles">Medium Roast</h3>
            <p>Medium roasts also have very little oil on the surface but are medium brown in colour. They are roasted until their internal
            temperature is 210°C - 220°C. They are taken off the heat right between the beans are about to roast a second time. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block roast-text-block">
        <h3 class="roasts_titles">Dark Roast</h3>
            <p>Dark roast feel heavier and will have oil showing on the surface. They have a much richer and dark colour than the other roasts.
            The beans are roasted until after their second cracking, at an internal temperature of 204°C or higher.  </p>

                <p>Coffee has a naturally complex botanical profile, with at least 1,000 natural compounds in the bean (including caffeine) and another 300 that are created during the roasting process. Scientists have linked a number of them, including some strong antioxidants, with a host of physiological benefits. Research has shown that moderate coffee consumption which is around 3-5 cups daily may be associated with many positive effects, such as the ones listed below:</p>
